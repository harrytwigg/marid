/**
 * Hidden speech-to-text context for the engine.
 *
 * When a submitted chat message carried speech-to-text-derived content, the
 * engine gets a short trusted note that transcription can mangle names, words,
 * and punctuation. The operator-visible message is never touched.
 *
 * `resolveMessageAudiences` is the single split: `visible` (byte-identical to
 * what the operator composed) feeds everything a human ever sees — the persisted
 * transcript row, the queue preview, callbacks, Activity, notifications — while
 * `engine` (note-prefixed, and only when speech-derived) feeds the model dispatch
 * alone. Because the note lives only in the transient `engine` string and is
 * recomputed from the clean text on every request, it never persists and can
 * never be duplicated across a retry, reload, or reconnect.
