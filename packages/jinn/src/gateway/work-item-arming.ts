/**
 * `asOperator` stamps the transition's recorded actor as `operator`, so a

 * COO arms on the operator's behalf.
 *
 * That actor string is an authority boundary — filtering on it is what keeps an
 * arbitrary employee from starting a pipeline nobody asked for — so exactly two
 * callers may claim it: the authenticated operator surface, for which it is a
 * no-op, and the gateway's own top-level agent session, the COO the operator is
 * talking to.
 *
 * The COO is deliberately NOT an org employee — the portal is the root, and
 * `resolveRootApprovalTarget()` answers with a VIRTUAL root that matches no
 * session's employee. So the claim cannot be keyed on an employee name; it is
 * keyed on the session shape only the operator's own surfaces produce
 * (`isPortalAgentSession`). An employee session never has that shape, and
 * neither does anything an employee can spawn.
 *
 * The claim never erases the claimant: the audit event's `actor` reads
 * `operator` for the trigger, and its `detail.asOperator` names the session that
 * actually made the call.
 *
 * A granted claim carries the operator's AUTHORITY too, not only their name:
 * the status route passes `human` into `transition()` for it, which is what
 * lets the COO release a sticky terminal on the operator's instruction.
 *
 * `resolveArmingDelegate()` below reaches the same trigger by a deliberately
 * narrower road: it rewrites no actor, applies only to `assigned`, and is
 * granted per employee by config rather than inferred from session shape. An
 * employee refused here can still be a delegate there, and that is the point —
 * arming a pipeline is a fraction of what claiming the operator buys.
