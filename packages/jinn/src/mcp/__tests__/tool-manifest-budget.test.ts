// Fixed provider budget. ~Zero headroom discipline: new tool prose must stay

// Exact gate: js-tiktoken 1.0.21 with its local o200k_base ranks. The provider

const ATTESTED = {
  // Rebased for `create_label`, `labels` on create_work_item, and `view` on
  // get_workflow_run (95 tokens, bought back by cutting four dead clauses).
  // Rebased again for `operatorOnly` on request_work_item_approval — the flag
  // that reserves a Todo gate for the human operator. It costs 8 tokens and
  // leaves Pi 9 under the ceiling, down from 17. The next addition to this
  // surface has to buy its own room back; there is no longer slack to spend.
  // Rebased for `assigned` on update_work_item's status enum: the agent lane
  // can now put a Todo back in the queue. It costs 2 tokens and leaves Pi 7
  // under the ceiling, down from 9.
  // Rebased once more for `asOperator` on update_work_item, which costs 24 and
  // broke the ceiling. Three dead clauses bought it back:
  //   - "Match role/persona fit;" on spawn_session — its own `employee` field
  //     already teaches the selection rule, one line below.
  //   - the field list on list_employees ("name, role, rank, department,
  //     engine, reporting") — the rows it describes carry their own keys. The
  //     part worth saying, that they include reporting lines, stays.
  //   - "Include own session." on search_messages — the property name says it,
  //     and the tool description already states the default it flips.
  // Rebased for `title` on edit_work_item, now that a Todo's content is open to
  // every session. It costs 9 tokens; the tool's own description bought 10 back
  // by dropping the field list ("Edit Todo title, body, acceptance, priority, or
  // dueAt.") that its schema properties already enumerate.
  // Rebased for `backlog` on update_work_item's status enum: "not now" is a
  // legitimate agent move. It costs 3 tokens and leaves Pi 3 under the ceiling.
  // Rebased for read_session's full-body and last=0 transcript contract. Its
  // concise field prose keeps Pi one token under the fixed ceiling.
  // Reattested for list_sessions' `pinned` scope. The new enum value spent
  // tokens; shortening its redundant description from an enumeration of the
  // same scopes to "by scope" bought those back plus four,
  // leaving Pi five under the unchanged ceiling.
  // Rebased for the three-tool heartbeats group (arm/list/stop). This is a new public capability rather than prose growth
  // on an existing tool, and unlike the earlier rebases there was no dead prose
  // left to buy it back with: its own descriptions were tightened first (19
  // tokens), and the remaining 175 are the group's honest cost. Pi stays five
  // under the ceiling, so the next addition still has to pay its own way.
  // Rebased for `blockKind` on update_work_item: the four-value enum that says
  // WHY a Todo is blocked, and with it where the block lands. It has to be on
  // the tool rather than inferred, because `dependency` returns the Todo to its
  // queue while the other three park it in front of a human, and a caller that
  // cannot say which gets the human every time. The enum plus its one clause of
  // routing prose cost 39; its own description already paid 3 of that back by
  // dropping "Why blocked.", which the property name says. Nothing dead is left
  // in this group to buy the rest from, so the ceiling moves by exactly the 39.
  // Pi stays five under it.
  // Rebased for `set_work_item_dispatch` and `idempotencyKey` on
  // create_work_item (ICI-733): how a Todo's next attempt runs, and a
  // caller-supplied create key. Like the heartbeats
  // group before it, this is a new public capability rather than prose growth on
  // an existing tool, and there was no dead prose left in this group to buy it
  // back with — its own description was tightened first ("and an engine/model
  // override" to "engine/model override", "while it is executing" to "while
  // executing"), and the remaining 126 are the addition's honest cost. Pi stays
  // five under the ceiling, so the next addition still has to pay its own way.
  // Rebased for `cascade` and `acknowledgeEscalated` on update_work_item
  // (PLA-96): closing a container and its open sub-tasks in one move, and the
  // separate word that lets that run over an escalated sub-task. Both have to be
  // on the tool — the route refuses a cascade it was not asked for, and refuses
  // one over an escalation until the caller says so, and a caller that cannot
  // say either has to close a dozen sub-tasks one at a time. Their prose was cut
  // to one clause each first ("the Todo's" to "its"; the repeated "Operator
  // surface only." dropped from the second, where the first already says it),
  // which paid 8 of the cost back. Nothing dead is left in this group to buy the
  // remaining 49 from, so the ceiling moves by exactly that. Pi stays five under.
  // Rebased for `offset` on read_knowledge and the cap it now names (PLA-100).
  // Both have to be on the tool: an agent that cannot see the boundary reads a
  // truncated file believing it whole, and one that cannot page has no way to
  // reach the rest. Its own description paid 2 back first ("N chars at a time;
  // page the rest with offset" to "N chars per call; offset pages the rest"),
  // and nothing dead is left in this group to buy the remaining 14 from, so the
  // ceiling moves by exactly that. Pi stays five under it.
  // Reattested for `verifyPolicy` on update_work_item (PLA-102): a Todo whose
  // product lands in the operator's workspace rather than in the diff has to be
  // able to say so on the tool that moves it, or the route is one the web
  // surface can declare and an agent cannot. It is a bare `{"type":"object"}`
  // and not one word of prose — the shared validator names every legal shape in
  // its refusal — so its whole cost is 7 tokens on each of the three wrappers.
  // It buys them back rather than moving the ceiling: `cost_report.groupBy`
  // carried the description "employee or day.", which is its own enum
  // `["employee","day"]` written out a second time in English, and dropping it
  // pays exactly 7 on each wrapper. So the ceiling, all three totals, and the
  // tool count are what `main` pinned; only the payload moved, so only the SHAs
  // do.
  // Reattested for `choice` on decide_workflow_approval (PLA-133): without it an
  // approval gate that offers variants is undecidable from MCP at all, because
  // approving one without naming a pick is refused rather than defaulted. The
  // bare `{"type":"string"}` costs 7 and not one word of prose. Two restatements
  // of an enum already in the schema bought 4 of that back, the same trade
  // `cost_report.groupBy` made: "Approve or reject" on this very tool, whose
  // `decision` enum is `["approve","reject"]`, and "with the original or current
  // definition" on rerun_workflow_run, whose `definition` enum is
  // `["original","current"]`. The remaining 3 fit under the unchanged ceiling —
  // Pi sits two below it, so the next addition still has to pay its own way.
  // Rebased for `parkedUntil` and `unblockHint` on update_work_item (PLA-157) —
  // the two fields that let a stopped Todo say whether it is waiting on a clock
  // or on a person. They cost 39. Three redundant clauses and two tightenings
  // bought 36 of that back:
  //   - the field list on set_work_item_dispatch ("skills to preload,
  //     engine/model override"), which its schema properties enumerate.
  //   - "supports threaded replies and local attachments" on comment_work_item,
  //     enumerated by its own `parentCommentId` and `attachments`.
  //   - "last=0 returns the whole transcript" on read_session, said again by
  //     `last`'s own "0=all (default 30)" one line below.
  //   - update_work_item's own `cascade` and `acknowledgeEscalated`, said in
  //     fewer words without losing either rule.
  // The two employee-selection clauses look like the same kind of duplication
  // and are NOT: exact-string tests in delegation-tools.test.ts and
  // session-tools.test.ts pin them, so they are contract, not prose.
  // `parkedUntil` carries no description of its own because the refusal names
  // the format at the moment it matters. The remaining 3 are the fields' honest
  // cost.
  // Rebased again for `mode` on label_work_item (PLA-155). Replace was the only
  // mode this tool had, so an agent told to drop one label had to re-send every
  // other label from memory to keep it — and a Todo that lost its arming label
  // that way sits at its arming status forever, because its lane trigger filters
  // on that label. The whole addition is one enum property and six words: `mode`
  // is `{"type":"string","enum":["add","remove"]}` at 14 tokens, and the tool's
  // own description went from "Set existing Todo labels." to "Set Todo labels;
  // mode add/remove keeps the rest." for 6 more. The alternative shape — sibling
  // `add` and `remove` arrays — cost 8 tokens more and let a caller name two
  // modes at once. No enum is restated in prose anywhere on this surface any more
  // and no field list duplicates its own properties, so unlike the earlier
  // rebases there was nothing dead left to buy the 20 back from; the ceiling
  // moves by exactly that. PLA-157's 3 land in the same release and take the
  // headroom the move would otherwise have left, so Pi sits exactly ON the moved
  // ceiling: the next addition to this surface has to buy its room BEFORE it
  // spends any.
  // Reattested for PLA-227: `assignee` left create_work_item's schema, because
  // creation no longer writes ownership — the assign flow is its only writer. It
  // gives 8 tokens back on each wrapper. The ceiling does not move, so Pi comes off
  // it and sits 8 under: this refactor hands the next addition its room back.
  // Rebased for `dispatch_work_item` (PLA-228): the Todo Shaper's handoff. The
  // Shaper's whole contract is to create one Todo and hand it on, and without
  // this verb it cannot — the dispatch route exists but has no MCP hand, so the
  // shaping half of quick capture would end at a Todo nobody starts. It is the
  // cheapest shape the capability has: a six-word description and one `id`
  // property, no prose the schema already carries. That is 64 tokens. Unlike
  // the earlier rebases there was nothing dead left to buy any of it back with
  // — PLA-155 already retired the last restated enum and the last duplicated
  // field list, and PLA-227's 8 are the headroom this spends first. So the
  // ceiling moves by exactly the remaining 56 and Pi sits ON it again: the next
  // addition to this surface has to buy its room before it spends any.
  // Rebased for `land_on_work_item` (PLA-228): the third way a capture can end.
  // Without it a capture that restated a Todo the board already had leaves only
  // a comment, and a comment is prose — the derived stage is not allowed to
  // pattern-match it, so the strip reported a correct dedupe as `failed`. The
  // verb writes the one fact the stage can read. It is the same minimal shape
  // as `dispatch_work_item`: a seven-word description and one `id` property.
  // That is 68 tokens. Four were bought back by cutting "on a Todo" from
  // `dispatch_work_item` — its own `id` property already names which Todo — and
  // there was nothing else left to cut, since S1 and PLA-155 between them took
  // the last of the restated enums and duplicated field lists. So the ceiling
  // moves by the remaining 64 and Pi sits ON it again. As before: the next
  // addition to this surface has to buy its room before it spends any.
  // Rebased for `intent` on delegate_task. A delegation links
  // the delegate's session to the Todo, and the self-review ban reads that link
  // as "you produced this" — so a reviewer delegated to close a Todo was
  // refused the close. The link now records WHY, and the Todo's own status
  // supplies the answer for the ordinary handoff (an `in_review` Todo is being
  // handed to a reviewer), which is why this property is an override rather
  // than a required field. It is the cheapest shape that still tells an agent
  // when to reach for it: two enum values and one clause naming the default,
  // no prose restating the enum. That is 31 tokens, and — as the paragraphs
  // above record — there is no dead prose left on this surface to buy them back
  // with, so the ceiling moves by exactly that and Pi sits ON it again. The next
  // addition to this surface has to buy its room before it spends any.
  // Rebased for `autoStart` on create_work_item and set_work_item_dispatch
  //. An instance's auto-start Workflow spawns the assignee's session
  // on backlog→assigned, so an employee that created a Todo and claimed it from
  // the session already working it got a second session on the same Todo. The
  // self-assign case is handled without any manifest cost (the assignment event
  // records the actor's employee); this property is the explicit opt-out for a
  // Todo that must wait for a hand-over. It is the cheapest shape that still
  // says what `false` does without overstating it: one boolean on each tool,
  // and a single clause on the create tool only — naming the todo-status
  // trigger filter that honours it, since a Workflow without that filter does
  // not — while the dispatch tool's boolean rides on it. That is 30 tokens,
  // and — as every paragraph above records — there is no dead prose left on
  // this surface to buy them back with, so the ceiling moves by exactly that
  // and Pi sits ON it again. The next addition to this surface has to buy its
  // room before it spends any.
  // Rebased for `compact_session`: a session compacting its own
  // context mid-task and resuming from a handoff, instead of dead-ending until a
  // human starts a new one. Like the heartbeats group this is a new public
  // capability, not prose growth on an existing tool. It is the cheapest shape
  // that still works: a twelve-word description, five bare string properties and
  // no property prose — the field names are the handoff's headings, and the
  // operating manual teaches what goes in each. Two property descriptions were
  // drafted and cut first (22 tokens). The remaining 84 are the tool's honest
  // cost, and there is still no dead prose on this surface to buy them back
  // with, so the ceiling moves by exactly that and Pi sits ON it again. Review
  // added "Main agent only:" (4 more): Claude Code Task sub-agents inherit the
  // jinn MCP with the parent's identity, so without it a sub-agent could compact
  // the main thread from a handoff written in its own narrow context. That
  // wording was then made precise (5 more): "main agent only" read as barring
  // Jinn child sessions — a Todo-dispatched session among them — which can and
  // should compact themselves. The bar is on a Task sub-agent, so it says that.
  // Rebased DOWN for the removal of the six Experiments tools and the sixteen
  // Workflow tools (and the prose spent on them above): the ceiling, all three
  // totals and the tool count moved down, and nothing moved up.
  // Rebased DOWN again for the reduced status set: `assigned` and `escalated`
  // left update_work_item's enum and the list enums, and `acknowledgeEscalated`
  // left the tool; the asOperator description grew to name the one move it now
  // makes, and the removals paid for that. Net 38 tokens off every total; the
  // ceiling follows them down and Pi sits ON it.
