/**
 * GRS-017e — the default-attachment machinery for the built-in `jinn` MCP
 * server (the company toolset).
 *
 * ONE decision point ({@link decideJinnAttachment}) answers "should this
 * session get the jinn toolset?" by composing, most-specific-last:
 *
 *   1. engine capability      — an engine without a proven per-session MCP
 *                               lever can NEVER attach (hard gate, nothing
 *                               overrides it);
 *   2. the master switch      — `mcp.gateway.enabled`: `false` is the global
 *                               KILL SWITCH (beats everything below), `true`
 *                               is on, absent falls through to the shipped
 *                               default ({@link JINN_ATTACH_DEFAULT});
 *   3. per-engine opt-out     — `mcp.gateway.engines.<engine>: false` detaches
 *                               one engine (a known-broken adapter shouldn't
 *                               attach) and beats per-employee force-on:
 *                               correctness over preference;
 *   4. per-employee override  — `employee.jinnMcp: true|false` force-attaches/
 *                               force-detaches ONE employee. The jinn-specific
 *                               field beats the general `mcp:` field
 *                               (specific-over-general); force-on works even
 *                               with no `mcp:` section at all, enabling a
 *                               single-employee pilot before the global flip.
 *                               The existing `mcp: false` / allowlist semantics
 *                               are unchanged when `jinnMcp` is unset;
 *   5. the default            — {@link JINN_ATTACH_DEFAULT}, ON since v0.26.
 *
 * …and then the AUTHED-SMOKE GATE is a MANDATORY CONJUNCT of every positive
 * result (GRS-017e-fix, codex finding 1): whatever arm said "attach" — master
 * on, employee override, or the shipped default — the decision only stands if the gate
 * is armed AND passed ({@link runJinnAuthedSmokeTest} verified the builtin
 * server can authenticate on THIS gateway). Failed gate → no attach (broken
 * tools are worse than no tools; the reason was logged at arm time). UNARMED
 * gate → no attach either: an attach path whose probe has not run yet is
 * uncertainty, and this module fails CLOSED under uncertainty. Negative
 * decisions never consult the gate.
 *
 * The resolver (mcp/resolver.ts) is the only production caller; jinn-server
 * membership in a resolved set is decided HERE and nowhere else.

 * child will read resolves, and the gateway accepts it (or needs no auth —
 * an auth-disabled gateway probing 200 unauthenticated is a WORKING config).
 * A full spawn-the-server-over-stdio probe was rejected as the gate form:
 * spawn/argv/env mechanics are engine-side contracts already pinned per-engine
 * by engine-wiring.test.ts, and a boot-time child process + JSON-RPC handshake
