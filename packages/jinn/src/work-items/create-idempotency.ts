 * Caller-supplied create idempotency (ICI-733).
 *
 * `(source, source_ref)` already dedupes machine mints, but the server picks
 * that pair and the trigger paths do not set it usefully — a cron that fires
 * twice, or a connector that retries after a timeout it never saw resolve,
 * makes a second Todo for the same intent. An explicit key lets the CALLER say
 * "this is the same create as before".
 *
 * The receipt stores a fingerprint of the create alongside the Todo it made,
 * mirroring `work_item_edit_receipts`. Replaying the same key with a materially
 * different payload is a caller bug, not a replay: answering it with the first
 * Todo would silently drop the second create, so it raises instead.
