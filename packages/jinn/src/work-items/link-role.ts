 * spend is this?" wants every session that touched the Todo; "who produced this
 * work?" wants only the ones that did it. The self-review ban asks the second
 * question, so a reviewer delegated onto a Todo — linked so their rounds are
 * attributed and their comments route — was read as its producer and refused
 * the one transition a reviewer exists to make.
 *
 * `execute` is the default and the legacy meaning: a NULL column is an
 * execution attempt, so nothing already in the database changes meaning.
