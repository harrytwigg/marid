 * `transition()`: only declared edges are allowed (illegal edges THROW, never
 * silently write), every change appends a `work_item_events` audit row in the
 * SAME transaction, sticky terminals (`done`/`cancelled`) are left
 * only under explicit human authority, the self-review ban is structural, and
 * the bounce rule (`in_review → executing` with `rounds++`) auto-escalates at
 * the policy's max rounds instead of looping. The GRS-003a reconciler and the
 * (phase-2) dispatcher are consumers of this module, not competitors to it.
