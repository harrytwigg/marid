# Organization

{{portalName}} supports an organizational structure with employee personas, departments, ranks, Todos, Workflows, and inter-agent sessions.

## Employee Personas

Employee files live at `~/.jinn/org/<department>/<name>.yaml`.

```yaml
name: alice
displayName: Alice
department: engineering
rank: senior
engine: claude
model: opus
persona: |
  You are Alice, a senior engineer focused on backend systems.
  You write clean, well-tested code and prefer simple solutions.
  You review PRs thoroughly and flag potential performance issues.
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | Unique identifier (lowercase, no spaces) |
| `displayName` | string | yes | Human-readable name |
| `department` | string | yes | Department directory name |
| `rank` | string | yes | One of: executive, manager, senior, employee |
| `engine` | string | yes | One of: claude, codex, antigravity, grok, pi, hermes |
| `model` | string | no | Engine-compatible model override (default from config) |
| `persona` | string | yes | System prompt defining personality and behavior |

## Departments

Each department is a directory under `~/.jinn/org/` containing:

```
~/.jinn/org/engineering/
  department.yaml     # Department metadata
  alice.yaml          # Employee persona
  bob.yaml            # Employee persona
```

### department.yaml

```yaml
name: engineering
displayName: Engineering
description: Builds and maintains the product codebase.
```

### Todos and Workflows

Todos are deliberately authored work in the live ledger. Employees find and update their assigned Todos, move finished work to in review, and use blocked or escalated only when they cannot proceed.

Workflows are reusable automations - the HOW. Use or propose one when the same job is repeatable, scheduled, event-driven, or multi-step. A Workflow invocation never creates, links, transitions, approves, or mutates a Todo. A Todo-status trigger is a one-way input; the resulting Workflow run is independent.

Workflow runs are durable records, not Sessions. Human approvals and cancellation belong to the Workflow run and never change a Todo.

## Ranks

| Rank | Privileges |
|---|---|
| **executive** | Full access. Can message any employee, modify org structure, create departments. {{portalName}} holds this rank. |
| **manager** | Can message employees in their department. Can assign and review department Todos. |
| **senior** | Can message employees in their department. Can update tasks assigned to them. |
| **employee** | Can update tasks assigned to them. |

## Communication

- **Downward**: Higher-ranked agents delegate work through sessions and Todos
- **@mentions**: Messages containing `@name` route to that specific employee
- **Todo-ledger**: Agents check and update their assigned Todos
- **Cross-department**: Executives and managers can delegate across departments when needed

## Default Organization

{{portalName}} ships with a single executive employee:

```yaml
name: {{portalSlug}}
displayName: {{portalName}}
department: executive
rank: executive
engine: claude
model: opus
persona: |
  You are {{portalName}}, the executive AI assistant and gateway administrator.
  You manage the organization, delegate tasks, and handle direct requests.
```
